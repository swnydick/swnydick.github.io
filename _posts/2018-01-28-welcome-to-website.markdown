Welcome to my website. It should contain all of the needed information about me
plus some of the projects/research that I have worked on over the years.
Many presentations/papers that I wrote were intended to help me remember 
material *years* after I studied them. I typically will include reports on the
[Reports](../reports) page, but I also might include some documentation as regular
posts.

I typically write code in `R`

{% highlight r %}
cat("hello!\n")
{% endhighlight %}

but I also know several other languages, including `Python`

{% highlight python %}
print("{}!".format("hello"))
{% endhighlight %}

I hope you find this useful. Please email me with any comments/questions.
