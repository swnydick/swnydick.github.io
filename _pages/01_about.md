I graduated from the University of Minnesota with a PhD in
Quantitative Psychology/Psychometric Methods, an MA in Psychometric
Methods, and an MS in Statistics.  My bachelorâ€™s degree is in
Mathematics and Psychology from Syracuse University.  Most of my
research and expertise involves Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT)
based on Item Response Theory (IRT).  IRT proposes underlying
trait(s) that account for responses to test/questionnaire items, and
CAT administers those items in real-time based on responses to
previous items.  That is to say, IRT provides a foundation for
measurement, and CAT determines the algorithm for efficiency in test
administration.  My dissertation applied CAT and IRT to
multiple-trait classification tasks with a well-defined passing
score.  I am also interested in simplifying procedures and analyses
using the R programming language.

Aside from IRT/CAT, my academic interests include estimation
algorithms, model-based cluster analysis (also known as mixture
modeling), matrix calculus, factor analysis, philosophy of
statistics, philosophy of science, history of statistics, and
statistical pedagogy.
